# ACE - Authentication and Authorization for Constrained Environments
This repository encompasses Python implementations for the three ACE entities
authorization server, resource server and client proposed in the IETF draft
https://tools.ietf.org/pdf/draft-ietf-ace-oauth-authz-12.pdf.

### Authorization Server
The authorization server can be run using

    python examples/authz_server.py

It binds to port number 8080 and issues CBOR Web Token (CWTs) access tokens. No security
profile is implemented for the communication with the authorization server,
therefore, HTTPS shoud be used.

### Resource Server
The resource server hosts some sample protected resources such as a
simulated temperature sensor value as well as an LED value that can be 
controlled via a request. The resource server can be run using
    
    python examples/rs_http.py
    
The RS will bind to port 8081.
    
#### Resources
    [GET] /temperature
    [POST] /led
    
#### Security Profile
The implemented security profile between the RS and client is based on
the EDHOC (Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman over COSE) IETF draft: https://tools.ietf.org/pdf/draft-selander-ace-cose-ecdhe-08.pdf

### Client
The client requests an access token from the AS and uses the issued 
token to access the protected resources on the RS. The client can
be run using

    python examples/client_http.py
